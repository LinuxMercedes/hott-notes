<h2>What's hot about HoTT?</h2>
<p>
Homotopy Type Theory augments the formulation of <a href="https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/one/type-systems-and-logic">types as logical propositions</a> with the means to express and derive proofs of these propositions. 
In other words, statements in homotopy type theory not only state that something is true, but why that thing is true. 
Furthermore, the way these proofs are expressed makes them easy to derive and manipulate algorithmically. 
</p>

<p>
HoTT has direct applications in proof checking systems and proof assistant software. 
At this point, its applications to computer science are mostly unexplored. 
</p>

<p>
The magic of HoTT comes from combining together elements of category theory and type theory. 
Unfortunately, that means that it's difficult to understand HoTT without taking graduate classes in mathematics and theoretical computer science. 
This set of notes is designed to fill in enough background detail that the layman can gather an appreciation for the theory.
