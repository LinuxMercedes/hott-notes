title: Type Theory and Constructive Logic
...

## A Brief Introduction to Type Theory

Type theory was [invented by Bertrand Russell](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2369948) to solve traditional logic's problems with self-referential statements (consider: "this statement is false").
In combination with the [Curry-Howard correpsondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence), we can understand types as logical propsitions and members of those types as proofs of those propositions.
